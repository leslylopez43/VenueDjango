- [Venue Manager User Stories](#venue-manager-user-stories)
# Venue Manager User Stories


- [Data Store Access Control](#data-store-access-control)
### Data Store Access Control

In our Venue Reservation Management System, we have implemented security measures to ensure that non-admin users cannot access the data store directly without going through the code. This is done to protect sensitive data and maintain the integrity of the system.  This ensures that sensitive data can only be accessed through the provided application interfaces, rather than through direct database queries or URL manipulation.


- [How It Works](#how-it-works)
### How It Works


- [Admin Access Middleware](#admin-access-middleware)

## `AdminAccessMiddleware`
We have employed a custom middleware, `AdminAccessMiddleware`, to intercept incoming requests. This middleware checks whether the user attempting to access the data store is an admin (staff member) or not. If the user is not an admin, they will encounter a # `PermissionDenied` exception, preventing them from accessing the data store directly.
![Ariel Logo](/media/products/middleware.webp)

- [Why Is This Important?](#why-is-this-important)
### Why Is This Important?

1. **Data Security**: By restricting direct access, we enhance data security, ensuring that only authorized personnel can interact with the data store.

2. **Controlled Access**: This approach enforces controlled access to sensitive information, reducing the risk of unauthorized data retrieval.


- [What Happens When a Non-Admin User Tries to Access the Data Store?](#what-happens-when-a-non-admin-user-tries-to-access-the-data-store)

### What Happens When a Non-Admin User Tries to Access the Data Store?

![Ariel Logo](/media/products/middleware_denied%20acces.webp)

When a non-admin user attempts to access the data store directly, they will receive a `PermissionDenied` exception. This exception can be customized to handle the situation according to your application's requirements. For instance, you can redirect the user to a login page, display a custom error message, or take any other appropriate action.

- [Customizing Exception Handling](#customizing-exception-handling)
### Customizing Exception Handling

To customize the behavior when a non-admin user encounters the `PermissionDenied` exception, you can modify the `AdminAccessMiddleware` or create a custom view and URL pattern to handle this exception gracefully.



Here's an example of how to create a custom view for handling the exception:

python
from django.core.exceptions import PermissionDenied
from django.shortcuts import render


- [Manage Venue Listings](#manage-venue-listings)

###  Manage Venue Listings
Superuser acces is the owner or Staff managment that can get access to the Admin Sistem
As a venue manager, I can manage venue listings by adding new venues, updating details, and marking venues as unavailable like(repair, leaking, fixing etc.).

- Design a user-friendly front-end that follows accessibility guidelines and UX design principles.
- Develop a Full Stack web application with interactive features and immediate data updates.
- Implement forms with validation for creating and editing models in the backend.
- Ensure a consistent and logical Django file structure.
- Write clean and well-organized code.
- Define application URLs consistently.
- Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout.

##  Design
### allauth app itself log in and out
In this section, it appears that the design of the application's authentication system is discussed. The "allauth" app is mentioned, suggesting that it is responsible for handling user login and logout functionalities.


An authentication mechanism has been implemented, allowing users to register and log in. Clear reasons for user registration are provided.

 ## Logo Creator
 ## Favicon.ico Retrieval

Within our project, you'll find a reference to the retrieval of a "favicon.ico" file. A favicon.ico file, often recognized as a small icon displayed in a web browser's tab or bookmark, is a significant component of web design. It serves as the visual representation of a website and enhances its recognition and user experience.

The inclusion of a favicon.ico file can contribute to the branding and identity of a web application. By associating a distinctive icon with our project, we aim to provide a memorable and visually appealing experience for users as they interact with our web application.

Please note that the favicon.ico file may vary in design and purpose, but its significance lies in its ability to create a recognizable visual identity for our project.

## Logo Creator - FreeLogoCreator.com

In our project, we utilized the services of [FreeLogoCreator.com](http://www.freelogocreator.com) to craft a distinctive logo for our project's README file.

[FreeLogoCreator.com](http://www.freelogocreator.com) is an online platform that offers user-friendly tools for creating logos and visual branding elements. Despite the minor typo in the URL, the website proved to be a valuable resource for designing a unique and visually appealing logo that complements our project documentation.

The logo not only enhances the aesthetics of my Project but also serves as a visual representation of our project, making it more memorable and recognizable to our users.

#### This file can be used to recreate the environment on another system or server using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt


#### Show Available Migrations
To view a list of available database migrations, run:


#### Execute Migrations
To apply pending database migrations, follow these steps:

Plan the migrations using:
shell
Copy code
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py migrate --plan


- [Database](#database)
## Database 
A relational database schema has been designed with clear relationships between entities. At least two custom Django models have been created, and forms with validation enable users to create records in the database.

The Django file structure is consistent and logical, following Django conventions. The codebase adheres to 'clean code' principles, making it readable and maintainable.

### Preview Migrations (Dry Run)
To preview database migrations without actually applying them, use the following command:
shell
python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run



###  Security 
Security measures have been taken to ensure that sensitive information, such as passwords and secret keys, is not exposed in the code repository. DEBUG mode is turned off to enhance security.


- [E-commerce Functionality](#e-commerce-functionality)
##  E-commerce Functionality

At least one Django app contains e-commerce functionality, which may include features such as shopping cart checkout, subscription-based payments, single payments, donations, etc. An online payment processing system, e.g., Stripe, has been integrated.

### 5.2 Code Cleanup

The deployed code is free of commented-out code and has no broken internal links.

The final version of the code has been successfully deployed to a hosting platform and thoroughly tested to match the development version.


#### Design and Build a User-Friendly Front End:
I will ensure that the front end of the application is designed with user-friendliness in mind. I'll follow user experience (UX) design principles to create an intuitive and easily navigable interface. Users will have full control of their interactions, and all data CRUD actions will provide immediate feedback in the user interface. The application's purpose will be clearly evident to new users, and it will effectively meet their demands and expectations. Additionally, the application will have a well-defined purpose tailored to a specific target audience or multiple related audiences.

#### Produce a Robust Codebase:
I will focus on producing a clean, maintainable, and robust codebase. This includes adhering to best coding practices, proper documentation, and writing code that is easy to understand and extend. I will also ensure that the project structure is organized and follows industry standards.

#### Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD):
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a crucial part of my development process. I will write comprehensive tests for both JavaScript and Python components and ensure that these tests are consistently updated and pass before new features or changes are added. You can expect to see TDD principles demonstrated in my git commits.

#### Efficient Project Configuration:
I will maintain an efficient project configuration with a well-maintained Procfile, requirements.txt file, and settings files. The data store configuration will be in a single location for easy modification. Additionally, I will provide a detailed data schema description in the project README file for reference.

#### Solid Understanding of Django:
My experience with Django and Django template syntax will allow me to efficiently handle data, logic, and views. I will ensure that Django logic is appropriately placed in the components where it is best suited, such as models for data handling and views for business logic.


#### Effective Use of Version Control:
I will use version control software effectively, providing a clear record of the development process. Regular commits and meaningful commit messages will be used to document each stage of the project's development.
