# Venue Manager User Stories

### Efficient Reservation Management: 
Ariel Venue streamlines the reservation management process for venue owners and managers. You can access a centralized dashboard that provides a real-time overview of all reservations, making it simple to optimize venue usage.

### Resource Management: 
Manage your venue's resources, such as meeting equipment, catering services, and staff availability, ensuring that everything runs smoothly for your clients.

### Communication: 
Stay in touch with event organizers through our messaging system, facilitating seamless communication regarding event details, changes, and special requests.

### Performance Insights: 
Gain valuable insights into your venue's performance with analytics and reporting tools. Monitor occupancy rates, revenue, and customer feedback to make informed decisions and enhance your offerings.

### Data Store Access Control
In our Venue Reservation Management System, we have implemented security measures to ensure that non-admin users cannot access the data store directly without going through the code. This is done to protect sensitive data and maintain the integrity of the system.  This ensures that sensitive data can only be accessed through the provided application interfaces, rather than through direct database queries or URL manipulation.


### How It Works



## `AdminAccessMiddleware`
We have employed a custom middleware, `AdminAccessMiddleware`, to intercept incoming requests. This middleware checks whether the user attempting to access the data store is an admin (staff member) or not. If the user is not an admin, they will encounter a # `PermissionDenied` exception, preventing them from accessing the data store directly.
![Ariel Logo](/media/products/middleware.webp)

### Why Is This Important?

1. **Data Security**: By restricting direct access, we enhance data security, ensuring that only authorized personnel can interact with the data store.

2. **Controlled Access**: This approach enforces controlled access to sensitive information, reducing the risk of unauthorized data retrieval.



### What Happens When a Non-Admin User Tries to Access the Data Store?

![Ariel Logo](/media/products/middleware_denied%20acces.webp)

When a non-admin user attempts to access the data store directly, they will receive a `PermissionDenied` exception. This exception can be customized to handle the situation according to your application's requirements. For instance, you can redirect the user to a login page, display a custom error message, or take any other appropriate action.

### Customizing Exception Handling

To customize the behavior when a non-admin user encounters the `PermissionDenied` exception, you can modify the `AdminAccessMiddleware` or create a custom view and URL pattern to handle this exception gracefully.



Here's an example of how to create a custom view for handling the exception:

python
from django.core.exceptions import PermissionDenied
from django.shortcuts import render



###  Manage Venue Listings
Superuser acces is the owner or Staff managment that can get access to the Admin Sistem
As a venue manager, I can manage venue listings by adding new venues, updating details, and marking venues as unavailable like(repair, leaking, fixing etc.).

 ## Favicon.ico Retrieval

Within our project, you'll find a reference to the retrieval of a "favicon.ico" file. A favicon.ico file, often recognized as a small icon displayed in a web browser's tab or bookmark, is a significant component of web design. It serves as the visual representation of a website and enhances its recognition and user experience.

The inclusion of a favicon.ico file can contribute to the branding and identity of a web application. By associating a distinctive icon with our project, we aim to provide a memorable and visually appealing experience for users as they interact with our web application.

Please note that the favicon.ico file may vary in design and purpose, but its significance lies in its ability to create a recognizable visual identity for our project.

## Logo Creator - FreeLogoCreator.com

In our project, we utilized the services of [FreeLogoCreator.com](http://www.freelogocreator.com) to craft a distinctive logo for our project's README file.

[FreeLogoCreator.com](http://www.freelogocreator.com) is an online platform that offers user-friendly tools for creating logos and visual branding elements. Despite the minor typo in the URL, the website proved to be a valuable resource for designing a unique and visually appealing logo that complements our project documentation.

The logo not only enhances the aesthetics of my Project but also serves as a visual representation of our project, making it more memorable and recognizable to our users.

### Gunicorn (Web Server)
Install Gunicorn, a popular web server for Django applications:
pip install gunicorn

Gunicorn, short for "Green Unicorn," is a popular Python Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) HTTP server. It's used to serve Python web applications, including those built with popular web frameworks like Django, Flask, and Pyramid. Gunicorn is known for its simplicity, performance, and compatibility with various web frameworks.

##### Here are some key features and points about Gunicorn:

## WSGI Compatibility: Gunicorn is WSGI-compliant, which means it can work seamlessly with any Python web application that adheres to the WSGI standard. This compatibility allows you to deploy a wide range of web applications using Gunicorn.
-**Concurrency**: Gunicorn provides support for multiple worker processes or threads. This concurrency allows Gunicorn to handle multiple requests simultaneously, making it suitable for serving web applications with concurrent user access.
Preloading: Gunicorn allows for process preloading, where worker processes are forked at startup. This helps minimize the latency associated with creating new processes when handling incoming requests.
-**Graceful Worker Processes**: Gunicorn can gracefully restart worker processes, which is crucial for maintaining the availability of a web application during updates or code deployments. This feature ensures that existing requests are completed before worker processes are replaced.
-**Configurability**: Gunicorn is highly configurable through command-line arguments, configuration files, or environment variables. You can fine-tune settings like the number of worker processes, binding to specific host and port, timeouts, logging, and more.
-**Production-Ready**: Gunicorn is designed for production use and is often used in conjunction with a reverse proxy server like Nginx or Apache. The reverse proxy server handles tasks like SSL termination, load balancing, and serving static files, while Gunicorn focuses on running the Python application.
-**Logging**: Gunicorn provides detailed logging options, making it easier to monitor and troubleshoot your web application. You can configure log levels and choose where log messages are written.
-**Compatibility with Process Managers**: Gunicorn can be managed by process management tools like systemd or Supervisor, which helps ensure that the server is running reliably and can automatically restart if it crashes.


## CSRF Protection and `@csrf_protect` in Django

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is a security vulnerability that can occur when an attacker tricks a user into unknowingly performing actions on a website. To counteract this type of attack, Django provides built-in CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection.

### Understanding CSRF Protection

Django's CSRF protection ensures that requests made to your Django application are legitimate and not forged by malicious actors. It does this by requiring that any POST requests made to your application include a valid CSRF token.

A CSRF token is a unique, server-generated value that is embedded in your HTML forms as a hidden field. When a user submits a form, the server checks this token to confirm that the request originated from the same site and is not a cross-site forgery attempt.

### Using the `@csrf_protect` Decorator

To apply CSRF protection to specific views in your Django application, you can use the `@csrf_protect` decorator. This decorator enforces CSRF token validation for the view functions to which it is applied. Here's how to use it:

1. Import `@csrf_protect` at the top of your `views.py` file:
 -**'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware'**
@csrf_protect.


## Using the `@login_required` Decorator

In web applications, user authentication plays a vital role in controlling access to specific views or resources. Django provides a convenient way to restrict access to authenticated users using the `@login_required` decorator.

### What is `@login_required`?

The `@login_required` decorator is a built-in Django decorator that ensures only authenticated users can access a particular view. When applied to a view function, it checks whether the user is logged in. If the user is authenticated, they can access the view. If not, they are redirected to the login page (you can customize this redirection URL if needed).

### How to Use `@login_required`

Using the `@login_required` decorator is straightforward. Here's how you can apply it to a view function:

1. Import `@login_required` at the top of your `views.py` file:

#### Benefits of @login_required
The @login_required decorator is a powerful tool for securing specific views in your Django application. It helps in:

Protecting sensitive or private content from unauthorized access.
Ensuring that only authenticated users can perform certain actions.
Enhancing the overall security and user experience of your web application.
By incorporating the @login_required decorator, you can effectively control access to your application's resources and provide a safer environment for your users.

## Important! Error Fix!
If you get the error below while following these instructions:
django.db.utils.OperationalError: FATAL: role "somerandomletters" does not exist
Please run the following command in the terminal to fix it:
unset PGHOSTADDR

-**In this context, PGHOSTADDR likely refers to the host address for a PostgreSQL database server. PostgreSQL is a popular open-source relational database management system. When connecting to a PostgreSQL database, you typically specify connection parameters such as the host address, port, username, and password. PGHOSTADDR specifically sets the host address for the PostgreSQL server**.

-**By running unset PGHOSTADDR, you are effectively removing the value assigned to the PGHOSTADDR environment variable. This can be useful when you want to clear or reset this variable, especially if you no longer want to use a specific host address for PostgreSQL connections or if you want to revert to the default settings**.

-**After running this command, the PGHOSTADDR environment variable will be empty, and if your PostgreSQL client or application relies on it, it will likely revert to its default behavior or prompt you for the host address when establishing a database connection**.




#### Production Dependencies Installation
For deploying your Django application in a production environment, you may need additional dependencies. Install them using the following commands:

Gunicorn (Web Server):
pip install gunicorn

psycopg2-binary (PostgreSQL Database Adapter):
pip3 install psycopg2-binary

## Creating an env.py file

Create a file called env.py.
Add the following code:
import os 

##### and then create a 
os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "paste-your-database-url-here"
In settings.py:
At the top of the file, add the following import:
import os 

if os.path.isfile("env.py"):
    import env
Replace the pasted-in database url with the following code: 
os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL")

#### Create a Requirements File

In this section, we provide a historical overview of the e-commerce capabilities integrated into the project. These functionalities enhance the user experience and enable seamless transactions within the application.

##### Shopping Cart Integration

Throughout the development of the project, we prioritized the implementation of a robust shopping cart system. Users can easily add, remove, and manage products in their cart while browsing available venues and services.

##### Secure Online Payment Processing

To facilitate hassle-free transactions, we integrated a secure online payment processing system. We chose Stripe, a widely trusted platform for handling online payments. This integration ensures the safety and convenience of making payments for reservations and additional services.

##### Diverse Payment Options

Our e-commerce functionality supports various payment methods, including credit card payments and PayPal, providing users with flexibility and convenience when finalizing their bookings.

##### Subscription and Single Payments

Whether users prefer subscription-based payments for ongoing services or one-time payments for specific reservations, our e-commerce system accommodates both payment models.

##### Future Enhancements

While we have successfully integrated these e-commerce features, we remain committed to ongoing improvements. In the future, we plan to enhance the e-commerce experience by introducing additional features and expanding payment options to further meet the needs of our users.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to refine and expand our e-commerce functionality to provide you with an even better reservation and booking experience.

## Code Cleanup

The deployed code is free of commented-out code and has no broken internal links.

The final version of the code has been successfully deployed to a hosting platform and thoroughly tested to match the development version.


#### Design and Build a User-Friendly Front End:
I will ensure that the front end of the application is designed with user-friendliness in mind. I'll follow user experience (UX) design principles to create an intuitive and easily navigable interface. Users will have full control of their interactions, and all data CRUD actions will provide immediate feedback in the user interface. The application's purpose will be clearly evident to new users, and it will effectively meet their demands and expectations. Additionally, the application will have a well-defined purpose tailored to a specific target audience or multiple related audiences.

#### Produce a Robust Codebase:
I will focus on producing a clean, maintainable, and robust codebase. This includes adhering to best coding practices, proper documentation, and writing code that is easy to understand and extend. I will also ensure that the project structure is organized and follows industry standards.

## Lighthouse Integration


In our Venue Ariel Reservation Management System, we have integrated Lighthouse, a powerful and essential tool for optimizing the performance and quality of our web application. Lighthouse plays a crucial role in ensuring that our website meets high standards for user experience and performance.

#### Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD):
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a crucial part of my development process. I will write comprehensive tests for both JavaScript and Python components and ensure that these tests are consistently updated and pass before new features or changes are added. You can expect to see TDD principles demonstrated in my git commits.

#### Efficient Project Configuration:
I will maintain an efficient project configuration with a well-maintained Procfile, requirements.txt file, and settings files. The data store configuration will be in a single location for easy modification. Additionally, I will provide a detailed data schema description in the project README file for reference.

#### Solid Understanding of Django:
My experience with Django and Django template syntax will allow me to efficiently handle data, logic, and views. I will ensure that Django logic is appropriately placed in the components where it is best suited, such as models for data handling and views for business logic.


#### Effective Use of Version Control:
I will use version control software effectively, providing a clear record of the development process. Regular commits and meaningful commit messages will be used to document each stage of the project's development.
